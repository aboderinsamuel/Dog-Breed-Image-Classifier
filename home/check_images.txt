Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classified Dog_01.jpg as 'pug'.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, only VGG and ResNet correctly identified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as 'pug'.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: The three model architectures identified the object picture as a non-dog, and correctly classified it as a 'steel bucket'. The cat picture was also identified as non-dog(cat), by VGG, Alexnet and ResNet. Conversely , only AlexNet classified the second dog image as 'bull mastiff', while Resnet and VGG classified it as 'pug' like dog image 1.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Both VGG and ResNet identified correctly 100% of dog images, their breeds, and non-dogs. Overall, the best-performing model architecture for this task was ResNet, because of its runtime of 00:00:04.VGG took a bit more than twice the time to complete the task, with a runtime of 00:00:09.
